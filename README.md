<h1>Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. The app will have a working Express.js API and use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.</p>

<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>AS A manager at an internet retail company, I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies, SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
</p>

<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<li>GIVEN a functional Express.js API, WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
</li>
<li>WHEN I enter schema and seed commands, THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
</li>
<li>WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application, THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
</li>
<li>WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
</li>
<li>WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
